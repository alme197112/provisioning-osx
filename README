Provisioning of development OS X box using Ansible

Notes

* VirtualBox and Vagrant need to be installed as root (or using sudo),
  thus they are not in the Ansible scripts and are supposed to be
  installed manually (or via brew cask?).

TODO
* Express dep on Ansible 1.6
* Define role dev-vm with ansible for vagrant
* Integrate dotfiles
* Gather fact in Ansible depending on output of command line (e.g. kerl - see if build is already installed - new module in galaxy?) in order not to try to build OTP anytime but only if not built yet
* Create ~/Applications directory via Ansible?
* Install Firefox Aurora via Ansible
* Compile Erlang/OTP using option re file descriptors at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/6143
* Re-evaluate Erlang/OTP OSX build options "./configure --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace --enable-darwin-64bit --disable-hipe"
