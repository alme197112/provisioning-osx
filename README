Provisioning of development OS X box

TODO
* Wrap all brew-related stuff in lib/brew then link it to ~/bin/brew, then remove export of vars in dotfiles. (Partial ref wrt bin/ http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html#usrlocalLocalHierarchy )
* Teach brew not to put stuff in system-wide cache (I suspect issues with multiple users accessing same cache).
* Gather fact in Ansible depending on output of command line (e.g. kerl - see if build is already installed - new module in galaxy?) in order not to try to build OTP anytime but only if not built yet
* Compile Erlang/OTP using option re file descriptors at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/6143
* Re-evaluate Erlang/OTP OSX build options "./configure --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace --enable-darwin-64bit --disable-hipe"
