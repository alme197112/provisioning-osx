Provisioning of development OS X box using Ansible

TODO
* Express dep on Ansible 1.6
* Define role dev-vm with virtualbox, vagrant, ansible for vagrant
* Integrate dotfiles
* Gather fact in Ansible depending on output of command line (e.g. kerl - see if build is already installed - new module in galaxy?) in order not to try to build OTP anytime but only if not built yet
* Create ~/Applications directory via Ansible?
* Install Firefox Aurora via Ansible
